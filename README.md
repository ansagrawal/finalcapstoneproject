This capstone project involves using React, NodeJS, Express and MongoDB to build an end-to-end "News Reader" application. The application allows users to create, submit and updated queries that return a list of news article along with links to those articles. The front-end of the application is a web application built with React. The back-end of the application consists of a REST service that manages requests for data from a MongoDB database, news queries that are passed through to an online REST api at newsapi.org and application state data that is saved and retrieved from disk by the REST service itself.

Here are some high-level points to remember about the project:
• You are required to construct the front-end application using React.
• You are required to construct the back-end applicaiton using NodeJS, Express and MongoDB.
• The back end application will make calls to a REST api at "newsapi.org". Calling this service requires an apiKey that you will obtain early on in the project by signing up for a free account at "newsapi.org"
• The end-to-end application should be functionally similar to the provided Demonstration application.
• You will create the application from scratch and add features according to the provided requirements.
• Development steps to follow are suggested later in this document.

Development Environment The project development environment includes:
• Windows, Mac or Linux PC
• Chrome web browser
• Internet Access
• Visual Studio Code Editor/IDE
